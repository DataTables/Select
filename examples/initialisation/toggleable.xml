<info><![CDATA[

Select is an extension for DataTables that provides table item selection capabilities. In its most simple form it can be enabled on a DataTable by setting the `se-init select` option to be `true`. This will enable Select's default options - row selection which is performed using the `-string os` method (click to select a single item, cmd/ctrl to add and remove items or shift to select a range of items) - see the `se-init select.style` option.

This example shows how to disable the deselection of rows by clicking on them by using the `-init toggleable` option. `-init toggleable` is `true` by default, meaning that clicking a selected rows will deselect it. By setting `-init toggleable` to `false` when a selected row is clicked it will remain selected rather than deselecting.  

On initialisation this example will preselect a row, meaning that at least 1 row will always have to have been selected at any given time.
