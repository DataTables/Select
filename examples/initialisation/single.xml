<info><![CDATA[

The `se-init select.style` option provides the ability to control how items are selected in the table. It is a string that can be used with one of the following options:

* `-string api` - Selection can only be performed via the API
* `-string single` - Only a single item can be selected, any other selected items will be automatically deselected when a new item is selected
* `-string multi` - Multiple items can be selected. Selection is performed by simply clicking on the items to be selected
* `-string os` - _Operating System_ (OS) style selection. This is the most comprehensive option and provides complex behaviours such as ctrl/cmd clicking to select / deselect individual items, shift clicking to select ranges and an unmodified click to select a single item.

This example shows the `-string single` option.
