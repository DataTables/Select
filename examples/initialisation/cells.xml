<info><![CDATA[

Select has the ability to select rows, columns and / or cells in a table. Row selection is the default behaviour as it is the most commonly used selection item type, but the items to be selected can be easily changed using the `se-init select.items` initialisation option, or after initialisation using the `se-api select.items()` API method.

This example shows cell selection using the `se-init select.items` option. Note that the `-string os` selection style to select multiple items will work equally well with cell selection as it does with row selection. Use shift click to select a range of cells and ctrl/cmd click to toggle the selection of individual cells.
