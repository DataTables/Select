<info><![CDATA[

A selected row is typically shown in a DataTable by using a highlight background colour - however, it can also be useful to use other styling options to convey the selected state of items in a table to the end user.

A common option is to use a checkbox which can be clicked on to toggle row selection, which can be particularly useful if you wish to restrict row selection activation to a particular column, so other actions can be performed on the other cells in the table (such as [inline editing](//editor.datatables.net/examples/inline-editing/simple)).

A column can be shown with a checkbox that reflects the row's selected status simply through use of the `-string select-checkbox` CSS class for that column (`dt-init columns.className`). Row selection can be restricted to that column using the `s-init select.selector` option.

The checkbox is not an `<input type="checkbox">` element, but rather a CSS that uses the `:before` and `:after` pseudo elements of the cell to draw a box and the tick. This can therefore be easily modified to suit the style of your site / app.
