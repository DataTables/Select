	<description>
		It can be useful to give your end users the ability to filter a table just to the rows that are currently selected, particularly when working with larger data sets. This button provides that ability by toggling a filter when activated. Toggling it a second time will remove the filter and show all rows again.

		Note that when in the filtered state, changing the selection does not automatically update the filter - the table will remain showing the rows that were selected when the button was activated until the next table redraw.

		Please note that this button **does not** work with server-side processing enabled. It uses client-side processing specific mechanisms to operate.
