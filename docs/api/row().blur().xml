		When `-init select.keys` is enabled rows in the table can gain focus to allow keyboard navigation. This method provides the ability to programmatically blur focus from a row - just as you might with an `-tag input` element.
		
		Note that this method only has an effect when `-init select.keys` is enabled. If that option is disabled (or has been disabled via `-api select.keys()`) this method will do nothing. It also will not throw an error - it is just a _no operation_ action.
