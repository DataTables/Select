	<description>
		Select has the ability to select rows, columns or cells in a DataTable. As well as being able to select each table element type you can also combine the selection to have multiple different item types selected at the same time.

		This option provides the ability to define which table item type will be selected by user interaction with a mouse. The items to be selected can also be defined at run time using the `s-api select.items()` method.
