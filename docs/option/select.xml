		This option can be used to configure the _Select_ extension for DataTables during the initialisation of a DataTable.

		When Select has been loaded on a page, all DataTables on that page have the ability to have items selected, but by default this can only be done through the API - i.e. the end user will have no ability to select items in a table by default. To enable end user selection, this option should be used (the `s-api select.style()` method can also be used after initialisation).

		Exactly what selection the user can make, and how, depends upon the options selected.
